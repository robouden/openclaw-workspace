## Session Notes

First real session with Rob. Got things working properly.

### Gateway token mismatch fix
- Systemd service had token `a605c...` (in `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` env var)
- Config file `openclaw.json` had a different token `ac94b...`
- Fixed by syncing `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.remote.token` in config to match the service file token
- Sessions are now accessible via `sessions_list` tool

### GitHub integration
- Generated SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) on the VPS
- Added public key to Rob's GitHub account
- Switched workspace remote from HTTPS → SSH (`git@github.com:robouden/openclaw-workspace.git`)
- First push successful ✅
- Added `.gitignore` (excludes `.jsonl` transcripts)
- Added `README.md` explaining the repo

### Convention established
- Auto-commit and push to GitHub after significant workspace changes

## Session 2 — Tailscale + OpenClaw WebChat

### Tailscale setup (userspace mode)
- `simplemap.safecast.org` is an **LXC container** — no `/dev/net/tun`, TUN module unavailable
- Fixed by running tailscaled in userspace networking mode
- Created `/etc/systemd/system/tailscaled.service.d/override.conf` with `--tun=userspace-networking`
- Tailscale IP: `100.76.253.38`, hostname: `simplemap.taila8498c.ts.net`
- Authenticated as `oudendijk.biz@gmail.com`
- Rob's Android tablet `p08-t` is also on the tailnet at `100.70.8.86`

### Tailscale Serve
- Set up with `tailscale serve --bg 18789` to proxy OpenClaw webchat
- Accessible at `https://simplemap.taila8498c.ts.net` (tailnet only)

### Duplicate node key issue
- Caused by repeated crash/restart loop during initial setup
- Fixed with `tailscale up --force-reauth`

### ACL note
- Tailscale ACL was already fully open (`*` → `*` on all ports) — no changes needed
