# 2026-02-24 - First Session

## What happened
- Fresh workspace setup
- Identity established: **Claw** 🐧 — helpful Linux expert assistant
- User profile created for **Rob Oudendijk** (CEO YR-DESIGN, Mitsue Japan)
- GitHub repos connected — settled on single repo: `openclaw-workspace`
- `openclaw-storage` deleted (twice — gh token needed refresh)

## VPS Setup (simplemap.safecast.org — 65.108.24.131)
- Ubuntu 24.04, Hetzner, 62GB RAM, 1.2TB disk
- Production Safecast server — be careful, don't touch existing services
- Running: AnyType, Docker, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, safecast-mcp
- Installed Node.js v22 + OpenClaw v2026.2.23
- Workspace cloned from GitHub to `/root/.openclaw/workspace`
- Gateway running as system service (`/etc/systemd/system/openclaw-gateway.service`)
- Gateway: loopback only, token auth, port 18789
- Rob connects via SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 18790:localhost:18789 root@65.108.24.131 -N`
- Web UI: http://localhost:18790/?token=ac94b68b28124f00f13941dc372a5dfb554484b6029776b9

## Pending
- [ ] Telegram bot setup (Rob has tablet with Telegram)
- [ ] Gmail API setup (Google Cloud project + OAuth credentials)
- [ ] AnyType API integration (AnyType already running on VPS)
- [ ] gh auth on VPS (needed for workspace push from VPS)

## Notes
- Rob is technically deep — guided through config wizard via screenshots
- VPS workspace needs its own git push setup
