## Session Notes

First real session with Rob. Got things working properly.

### Gateway token mismatch fix
- Systemd service had token `a605c...` (in `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` env var)
- Config file `openclaw.json` had a different token `ac94b...`
- Fixed by syncing `gateway.auth.token` and `gateway.remote.token` in config to match the service file token
- Sessions are now accessible via `sessions_list` tool

### GitHub integration
- Generated SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) on the VPS
- Added public key to Rob's GitHub account
- Switched workspace remote from HTTPS → SSH (`git@github.com:robouden/openclaw-workspace.git`)
- First push successful ✅
- Added `.gitignore` (excludes `.jsonl` transcripts)
- Added `README.md` explaining the repo

### Convention established
- Auto-commit and push to GitHub after significant workspace changes
