## Local OpenClaw fix
- Rob's local machine broke after running out of Anthropic credits and attempting to switch to Qwen
- Error: "No API key found for provider 'anthropic'" — auth-profiles.json had no valid credentials
- Fixed by enabling Qwen portal plugin, authenticating via OAuth, and setting as default model
- Commands used:
  ```
  openclaw plugins enable qwen-portal-auth
  openclaw gateway restart
  openclaw models auth login --provider qwen-portal --set-default
  openclaw models set qwen-portal/coder-model
  ```
- Working again on free Qwen tier (2000 req/day)
